The social media giant is testing the feature, which will show posts exclusively from users who have paid for Meta's Verified subscription, among a limited number of users, as Meta continues to explore ways to get more users to pay for its platforms. \\\"We're exploring this as a new control for people and a way for businesses and creators to get discovered,\\\" said Instagram boss Adam Mosseri, in comments on his Instagram broadcast channelreported by the Verge. The ability to post in the new verified channel will be available for all users who pay for Meta's verified badge. The paid subscription, which wasannounced by Mark Zuckerberg in February, costs $12 on the web and $15 on the Instagram app. At the time, Zuckerberg wrote that Instagram verified would increase \\\"authenticity and security\\\" by requiring paying users to confirm their identity in exchange for features such as increased visibility and \\\"direct access\\\" to customer support. The subscription service, which saw Meta break with its longstanding practice of not charging users for its social media products, was initially trialed in Australia and New Zealand before being rolled out in the US a month later. Meta is also reportedly considering plans tocharge users in Europefor access to ad-free versions of Instagram and Facebook, as it grapples with new EU rules on personalized advertising. Social media companies are increasingly moving away from the traditional model of free-but-with-ads that has allowed platforms such as Instagram and Facebook to become global behemoths. X, formerly known as Twitter, introduced paid verification a few months before Meta, and has continued to experiment with directly charging usersdespite its disastrous launch. X owner Elon Musk recently announced that it would begincharging users a $1 annual feein order to cut down on the number of bots using the site. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider, made outside normal working hours.\",\n          \"The bright orange hotel sticks out as far as the eye can see - but unfortunately for its owner Bishnu Sharma, there is hardly anyone there to see it.  His hotel offers breath-taking mountain views from the town of Lumbini in Nepal - Buddha's birthplace.  But a hoped-for surge in tourist numbers has failed to materialise, blamed in part on tensions between Nepal's giant neighbours India and China. Lumbini saw close to a million visitors in 2022, according to the Lumbini Development Trust - and it was this number the government was betting on when it spent $76m (\\u00a361m) to build the Gautam Buddha International Airport, which opened in May last year.  Domestic tourists make up most of the visitors, with just less than a third travelling from neighbouring India.  The terminal, also known as Bhairahawa Airport, lets tourists fly directly to Lumbini instead of travelling 250km (155 miles) by land from the capital, Kathmandu. Yet the anticipated travel boom never materialised, something travel industry experts attribute to a lack of early promotion and incentives to international airlines.  \\\"The government asked us to expand tourism infrastructure saying more international flights would come. But my hotel is two-thirds empty. I am now struggling to repay my loan,\\\" Mr Sharma tells the BBC, adding that he is millions of rupees in debt.  Travel industry experts argue tourist arrivals, particularly from overseas, will go up if there are regular scheduled international flights operating out of Bhairahawa airport. But Nepali officials say Delhi has refused to allow big passenger planes to fly west through its airspace - meaning planes cannot fly over India to reach the Gautam Buddha airport.  Access to Indian airspace would mean shorter flights at lower cost. Some in Nepal also believe that Delhi is wary of the fact that the Gautam Buddha airport was constructed by China's Northwest Civil Aviation Airport.  The airport is also located near Nepal's border with India  - west of where the two Asian giants' troops clashed last December in the Arunachal Pradesh region, just seven months after the terminal opened to international traffic. In 2020, a major encounter between India and China killed at least 20 troops. At the centre of their dispute is an ill-defined, poorly-demarcated 3,440km (2,100-mile)-long border- called the Line of Actual Control, or LAC.  The presence of rivers, lakes and snowcaps means the line can shift. The soldiers on either side - representing two of the world's largest armies - come face to face at many points. The situation at the border is mirrored by growing political tension, with strained ties between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Observers say talks are the only way forward because both nuclear-armed countries have much to lose. The two countries have fought only one war, in 1962, when India suffered a humiliating defeat. The Gautum Buddha airport was meant to be the key to Nepal's plan to grow traffic by easing the load of Kathmandu - which has been for years its only international gateway. Kathmandu Airport is heavily congested and was briefly shut down by a powerful earthquake in 2015. A third international airport located in Pokhara - a town with stunning views of the Annapurna mountains and known for adventure sports - is facing a familiar problem to Bhairahawa.  Since it opened last January, the airport - built with a $215m loan from China - has not welcomed any international flights, save for a charter flight from Chengdu that brought in Chinese officials and tourists. Currently, Gautama Buddha and Pokhara have a combined traffic of 80-85 domestic flights per day. But experts say the terminals need substantial international traffic to sustain operations. \\\"I don't think only domestic flights will make these two airports commercially viable. It may be difficult to repay the loan without regular international flights,\\\" says Tri Ratna Manandhar, the former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Pokhara International Airport chief Bikram Raj Gautam says Nepal needs \\\"proactive diplomacy\\\" to convince countries like India to open their airspace to commercial flights that will land in Nepal. Experts say Nepal can also look at attracting tourists from the east like Thailand, Japan and Cambodia, while Delhi's restrictions choke traffic from the west. Nepal Airlines has just started a weekly flight from Bhairahawa to Kuala Lumpur - something that should send a positive message to other airlines, Dipak Bajracharya, director of the Gautam Buddha International Airport tells the BBC. But Nepal's minister for tourism and civil aviation, Sudan Kiranti, remains optimistic that there will be a resolution with Delhi - and soon.  \\\"We are in constant touch and dialogue with Indian officials and diplomats,\\\" he tells the BBC. \\\"They are very positive.\\\" With additional reporting by Surendra Phuyal in Kathmandu\",\n          \"Cricket-mad India is currently hosting the sport's flagship event, theODI World Cup\\u2013 but fans who want to see the national team play live might have to pay thousands of dollars for the privilege. Tickets are reselling on secondhand marketplaces for sky-high prices, while supporters are complaining that the process to buy seats for marquee games has been poorly managed. India are set to face Pakistan in the western city of Ahmedabad on Saturday. The match-up is one of cricket's fiercest rivalries but only takes place during World Cups, because India's governing body severed ties with Pakistan's after the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks. On the resale siteeticketing.co, the cheapest seats sell for over 50,000rupees($600), while the most expensive are available for as much as 240,000 rupees, or nearly $3,000. Meanwhile, former derivatives trader Nikhil Wadhwani toldBloombergthis week that he'd snapped up a ticket to the game for just $30 back in August \\u2013 and then sold it on X for over $250, netting a 780% gain. \\\"I was absolutely shocked to see the demand,\\\" Wadhwani said in an interview with the outlet. Some fans have complained that the buying process has been chaotic, creating opportunities for scalpers. Having said the India-Pakistan clash was sold-out, the tournament's organizers put another 14,000 tickets on sale at around $20 Sunday \\u2013 under 1% of what some fans have paid for seats on secondhand sites. Theofficial websitefor the World Cup says tickets for future India matches are \\\"coming soon\\\" \\u2013 even though the Rohit Sharma-led side are slated to take on New Zealand in Dharamsala in just 10 days' time. The ticketing fiasco is just the latest example of a trend that's emerged since the pandemic: even though the world economy is slowing down and some developed countries are flirting with a recession, people are willing to pay through the nose to see live events. Taylor Swift fansspent thousands of dollarsto see the \\\"Anti-Hero\\\" singer's Eras Tour, even if it meantflying to a different continentwhere tickets were more readily available. Seats to see Beyonc\\u00e9 and Olivia Rodrigo have been changing hands for similar prices. The cost of seeing the NBA and both professional and college football live has alsoedged up steadilyin recent years, while tickets for a series of cricket matches betweenarch-rivals England and Australiaearlier this summer cost around 190 pounds ($230) firsthand.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The X owner confirmedreportsthat the social media site is planning to overhaul its X Premium subscription, adding a cheaper tier and a more expensive ad-free version as it seeks to bring in more paying subscribers. \\\"Two new tiers of X Premium subscriptions launching soon,\\\" said Muskin a post on X. \\\"One is lower cost with all features, but no reduction in ads, and the other is more expensive, but has no ads,\\\" Musk wrote. Bloombergreported earlier this monththat X was testing a triple-tiered premium model, with cheaper versions of the current $7.99 subscription. X Premium, formerly Twitter Blue, wasone of Musk's first major overhaulsfollowing his takeover of Twitter last year, allowing users to buy a verified checkmark for $8 a month. The initial launch backfired spectacularly when the site was quickly overrun with impersonations of major celebrities and brands, includinga fake Eli Lilly accountthat sent the pharmaceutical company's stock price plunging when it tweeted: \\\"Insulin is free now.\\\" The subscription service has since been overhauled and expanded, with subscribers getting an edit button and fewer ads. However, the number of people paying for itremains small, with researchers estimating only 900,000 of X's245 milliondaily active users are subscribed, suggesting that it is unlikely to make up forthe company's lost advertising revenue. The latest changes to the service come as X starts charging new users in thePhilippinesand New Zealandan annual fee of $1to use the platform through its \\\"Not a Bot\\\" trial program. The company has said that the fee is not a profit driver but is instead meant to make it unaffordable for bots to operate on the platform. Musk has often floated the idea of charging users, and suggested in a livestream last month that hecould put X behind a paywall, calling it \\\"the only defense against an army of bots.\\\" Social media's free-with-ads model has been the key driver of its enormous success, but amid a global advertising recession and changes toApple's app-tracking rules which make it harder for these platforms to target ads to customers, many are now looking at alternative solutions. Meta is reportedly consideringcharging users in Europe $14 a monthto access ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram, as it grapples with new EU rules that would allow users to opt out of personalized ad-tracking. TikTok, meanwhile, is testing a $4.99-a-monthad-free subscription tier. X did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider, made outside normal working hours.\",\n          \"Women are constantly being reminded that math is not for them. Sometimes it's subliminal: a young woman scanning a sea of male faces in her STEM lecture. But often it's more overt, as with TikTok's most recent viral trend: \\\"girl math.\\\" The stereotype runs deeper than many of us even realize. As I was bombarded with #girlmath videos, it hit me that I don't consider myself to be \\\"good\\\" at math. Though I didn't get a degree in STEM, I achieved high math grades in school. I studied hard to become a qualified wealth advisor in both the UK and the US \\u2014 a first for my company at the time. But still, not good at math. And then, even with a whole host of qualifications to confirm my financial and mathematical skills, when a friend saw my trading app he asked, \\\"Does your boyfriend pick those investments for you?\\\" My boyfriend is an engineer, with no financial experience or qualifications. The comment had no malice but jolted me to the ingrained stereotype. Even when women are qualified and experienced in numbers, TikTok tells its audience that girls aren't mathematically capable. The trend pokes fun at irresponsible personal-finance habits, dubbing them girl math. TikTok creators explain to their audiences that #girlmath meansa purchase is free if you pay for it in cash you didn't remember you had, thatnot spending $50 on some shorts you wanted to buy is basically the same as making $50, and \\u2014 most concerningly \\u2014 thata purchase is free when it's on your credit card. According to the Evening Standard,the trend emergedafter a clip of hosts on the New Zealand radio station FVHZMwent viral on TikTok. The clip was of the show's segment in which female listeners call in to justify their big purchases with the excuse of \\\"girl maths.\\\" The TikTok video spurred a wave of videos in response with women discussing how they justified spending that could be viewed as impractical. Seemingly lighthearted, the hashtag plays into a damaging stereotype that women are bad at math. The Institute for Fiscal Studies found in the UK in 2018 that more girls than boys received A-level certifications \\u2013 but female students made uponly 39% of math A-level results, and 22% of physics results. The imbalance in women studying math-based topics is reiterated in higher education. UCAS data shows non-male students \\u2013 participants who identified as women or nonbinary \\u2013 only made up31% of students studying mathematicsat universities in the UK. But historically, women have excelled in mathematics. Caroline Criado Perez, the author of \\\"Invisible Women,\\\" highlights Dainan Tamina, a female mathematician who solved a complex problem that had eluded mathematicians for centuries in 1997. Shakuntala Devi holds a world record forperforming the \\\"fastest human computation.\\\" We've got evidence of female mathematicians solving some of the world's greatest problems, yet #girlmath perpetuates the belief women just aren't mathsy. The #girlmath trend focuses on \\\"feminine\\\" spending habits as lavish \\u2014 another common stereotype of women and money management. A Guardian report found that65% of financial articles directed at womencharacterized them as \\\"splurgers\\\" and sought to teach them how to rein in their wild feminine spending tendencies. This content usually revolves around childlike images of piggy banks, or simplified techniques of stretching budgets ever further. Stereotyping women as having poor maths skills has a direct correlation with an unwillingness to engage with finances. A 2021 study in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization suggests the stereotype that women are less financially literate increases their anxiety around money. In a 2021 study of 2,400 American adults making an annual income of $50,000 or more, Fidelity found only a third of female participants said they were confident in their ability to invest. Even though a Fidelity analysis of 5 million of its customers from a recent 10-year period found that women actually slightly outperformed men. In response to #girlmath, the trend #boymath has also started to emerge. This trend appears to balance the perceived financial illiteracy scales. \\\"Boy math\\\" was defined by one X user as \\\"paying $44 billion for a $25 billion company and, through business smarts and entrepreneurial know-how, turning it into an $8.8 billion company.\\\" The tweet alludes to Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, which he rebranded to X. It is worth noting that the boy-math trend seems to illustrate illogical male behavior in a more general sense, whereas girl math is pointedly financial. When the trend's negative spotlight is directed toward men, it avoids conflating men with poor financial habits. The girl-math trend brings women's financial literacy and investing into the limelight. Though the trend itself perpetuates negative stereotypes, it opens up discussions around gender and financial well-being. Why do women cede financial responsibility to their male counterparts? Why do womensave less on average? Most of these debates boil down to the gender pay gap and continued systemic misogyny. So, while TikTok trends like #girlmath may seem funny and fleeting, the stereotypes and systems they play into are not. Zoe Burtis a financial content specialist forFemale Invest.

The shaking also caused a landslide in the region, Hum Nath Parajuli, a district government administrator, said. Details were not immediately available. The area is nearly 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of Kathmandu, and the earthquake was felt in the Nepalese capital. Nepal\\u2019s National Earthquake Monitoring and Research Center gave a preliminary magnitude of 6.1. The U.S. Geological Survey provided measurements of a 5.2 magnitude with a depth of 24.7 kilometers (15.4 miles) and an epicenter near Bharatpur. Three tremors of 4.3, 4.1 and 3.8 magnitude also hit the region later Sunday, according to India\\u2019s Center for Seismology. The Press Trust of India news agency said the tremors were also felt in Bagmati and Gandaki provinces and caused panic among people. One woman suffered injuries in the Gorkha district, which adjoins Dhading, when she jumped from a two-story building, Parajuli said. Earthquakes are common in mountainous Nepal. A 7.8 magnitude earthquake in 2015 killed some 9,000 people and damaged about 1 million structures.\",\n          \"NEW DELHI: India preferred Bangladesh over Nepal for the post of regional director of World Health Organisation\\u2019s (WHO) Southeast Asia Region contributing to the comfortable victory of Saima Wazed, daughter of Bangla PM Sheikh Hasina .Although officials were tight-lipped about which way India voted, sources said that it voted for Wazed at the expense of Dr Shambhu Acharya, who could manage one vote, apart from Nepal\\u2019s.It could not have been an easy decision as India has been working to improve ties with both neighbours. The decision may have been influenced by Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina\\u2019s effort to stop Islamic terrorist groups, many of them backed by Pakistan, from using Bangladesh as a base to launch attacks against India. The personal stake of Sheikh Hasina, who faces an increasingly tough situation on the domestic front ahead of elections next year, in the outcome of a contest featuring her daughter and China\\u2019s effort to woo her, also perhaps helped tip scales in Wazed\\u2019s favour.Wazed, who is a global autism advocate and has been a member of the WHO\\u2019s 25-member expert advisory panel on mental health, would have won in any case as eight of the 10 member nations preferred her over Dr Acharya who is a WHO specialist.WHO said that Wazed\\u2019s nomination will be submitted to the WHO executive board during its 154th session, taking place on 22-27 January 2024 in Geneva, Switzerland, and that the newly appointed regional director will take office on 1 February 2024.The Bangladesh High Commission, in its statement announcing the victory, said their ministry of foreign affairs, in coordination with the ministry of health and family welfare, conducted an effective campaign in Wazed\\u2019s favour since the very beginning of the election process.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment_textblob_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.07027415268110633,\n        \"min\": -0.07777777777777779,\n        \"max\": 0.13636363636363635,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.13636363636363635,\n          -0.07777777777777779\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment_textblob_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.061060247863213665,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.22414772727272725,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.07201073232323232\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment_vader_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.39736058086103887,\n        \"min\": -0.5106,\n        \"max\": 0.6597,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.6597\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment_vader_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8969760583947228,\n        \"min\": -0.9973,\n        \"max\": 0.9963,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -0.9349,\n          0.8934\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Helped by centuries from Quinton de Kock and Rassie van der Dussen, the Proteas posted 357-4 after being asked to bat first by New Zealand stand-in captain Tom Latham on Wednesday.

The big partnership really set it up for the boys. \\u201cWith the ball, we sustained the pressure throughout their innings. \\u2026 Quite clinical with the execution of our skills.\\u201d The Proteas built on the de Kock and van der Dussen 200-run stand with 119 in the last 10 overs as David Miller put the New Zealand bowlers to the sword with a 30-ball 53. \\u201cWe were speaking about 300 to 320 at one stage in the middle, but we\\u2019ve seen so often in the last 12 to 18 months what the guys coming in can do,\\u201d player of the match van der Dussen said. \\u201cWe knew if we could set a platform again for them, I mean the sky\\u2019s the limit. We [almost] got to 360, so we were pretty chuffed about that.\\u201d Kiwi Tim Southee dismissed van der Dussen on a day of little joy for New Zealand, who had lost the bowling services of seamer Matt Henry due to a right hamstring problem midway through South Africa\\u2019s innings. Neesham was struck on the hand while stopping a ball off his own bowling and was able to bat only at number nine although he did not suffer broken bones. \\u201cNot our best performance,\\u201d Latham said. \\u201cWe were put under pressure with that massive partnership Rassie and Quinton had up top. \\u201cAt the halfway mark it was a big score but a decent surface. From a batting point of view, you need partnerships.

Premium Plus builds on the perks that come with X\\u2019s standard Premium plan (formerly Twitter Blue), which includes a blue checkmark, the ability to edit tweets, longer posts, longer video uploads, encrypted direct messages, and more.

The standard Premium subscription costs $8 per month if purchased directly. Earlier this month, a report from Bloomberg emerged that X had been testing new paid membership tiers . Since taking over last year , owner Elon Musk has begun searching for ways to monetize the platform and even started making users in New Zealand and the Phillippines pay $1 per year to access X.
